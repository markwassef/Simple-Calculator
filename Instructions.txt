Simple Calculator - Instructions

1. Compilation:
   - Open a C++ compiler or IDE of your choice.
   - Create a new C++ project or file.
   - Copy and paste the calculator code into the project or file.

2. Building and Running:
   - Compile the code using the compiler or IDE.
   - Run the compiled program.
   - The program will prompt you to enter two numbers and an operation.

3. Performing Calculations:
   - Enter the first number.
   - Enter the desired operation: + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division.
   - Enter the second number.
   - The program will display the result of the calculation.

4. Error Handling:
   - The program handles division by zero and displays an error message in such cases.
   - Make sure to provide valid input and avoid dividing by zero.

5. Customization and Enhancements:
   - Feel free to modify the code to add more features or enhance the calculator's functionality.
   - You can implement additional operations, support decimal numbers, or handle more complex expressions.

Note: This is a basic calculator program designed to perform simple arithmetic calculations. It may not cover all edge cases or handle complex expressions. Use it as a starting point for learning and experimentation.
